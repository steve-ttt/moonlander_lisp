# Common LISP port of Osbourne's Moonlander from "Computer Space games"

##  Usborne 1980s Computer Books

When I was in primary school (when music came on cassette tape), I saved up money to buy a computer I wanted a C64 but ended up buying a Dick Smith Electronics VZ300 (rebranded, video technology - Laser 310) it was cheeper. For my b'day my I was given the Osbourne "Computer Space Games" book. I spent many hours typing in programs in BASIC from that book (and many other books).

## Common LISP

I had the idea I might like to port some .. maybe all .. the games in that book to Common LISP. So this is my first attempt. It is not a direct port as I've made some changes along the way but I've tried to keep in the original spirt of the original BASIC game listing.

Common Lisp is a high-level programming language that offers several advantages:

*Interactive Development Environment: Common Lisp provides an extremely agile, interactive, and conversational development environment.

*Dynamic Programming: It allows you to create and update programs and applications dynamically.

*High-Level Debugging: Common Lisp provides high-level debugging capabilities.

*Support for Various Data Types: It supports all kinds of data types like objects, structures, lists, vectors, adjustable arrays, sets, trees, hash-tables, and symbols.

*Code is Data and Data is Code: Lisp has a unified, simple, and elegant way of representing both code and data.

*Powerful Abstraction Capabilities: Lisp gives you unprecedented power to create and manipulate abstractions.

*Functional Programming: Lisp supports functional programming paradigms.

*Extensibility: Lisp is easily extensible.

These features make Common Lisp a powerful tool for solving complex problems.
